/// - `tx_audio_hz`, the per-band transmit offsets, written by

/// - `contest_serial`, the next contest exchange's serial number, advanced by
///   the engine itself as each contact is logged and set by hand through
///   `Command::SetContestSerial`. The staleness here is not hypothetical: a

/// Found the hard way, minutes after the offsets went in. 60 m's was set,
