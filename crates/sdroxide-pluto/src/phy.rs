//! The AD9361/AD9363 front end, addressed through IIO attributes.
//!
//! Three IIO devices make up a Pluto. `ad9361-phy` is the transceiver itself —
//! local oscillators, sample rate, analog filter, gains, AGC mode, port
//! selection. `cf-ad9361-lpc` and `cf-ad9361-dds-core-lpc` are the receive and
//! transmit DMA buffers, which carry samples and nothing else.
//!
//! # Read the limits, do not assume them
//!
//! Every limit this backend reports to the UI is read off the device through an
//! `_available` attribute. That is not fastidiousness: the same firmware runs on
//! a stock AD9363 board (325 MHz–3.8 GHz) and on one unlocked to AD9364
//! (70 MHz–6 GHz), and the receive gain range moves with frequency. Hardcoding
//! either would mean half the Plutos in circulation refusing frequencies they
//! can reach, or accepting ones they cannot.
//!
//! Where a firmware publishes no `_available`, a fallback is used **and
//! recorded** in [`PlutoLimits::assumed`], which the source adapter surfaces
//! through `IqSource::open_status` — a limit that was guessed should say so
//! rather than look like a measurement.
//!
//! # The two channels called `voltage0`
//!
//! In IIO the AD9361's receive chain is `INPUT voltage0` and its transmit chain
//! `OUTPUT voltage0`. They share a name and several attribute names
//! (`hardwaregain`, `rf_bandwidth`, `sampling_frequency`) and are entirely
//! different things — receive `hardwaregain` is gain in dB, transmit
//! `hardwaregain` is *attenuation* expressed as negative dB.
