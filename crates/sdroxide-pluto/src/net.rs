//! The live connection to a Pluto: [`PlutoHandle`], the state its three
//! threads share, and the control thread that owns the AD9361.
//!
//! # Why three connections
//!
//! IIOD is strictly request/response on one socket, and `READBUF` blocks until
//! the device has filled a buffer — 63 ms at the lowest rate offered here. A
//! retune sharing that socket would queue behind it, so the dial would lag the
//! knob by a buffer. `iiod` is a thread-per-connection server, so instead this
//! opens three: control, receive and transmit, each owned by one blocking
//! thread. (`iiod` may still hold a per-device lock, so a retune issued
//! mid-buffer can wait that long inside the server; that is a bounded stall in
//! the right place, not a queue that grows.)
//!
//! # Half duplex by default, full duplex by choice
//!
//! The AD9361 is a full-duplex part — a synthesiser per direction in FDD — so
//! what decides this is the link, not the silicon. A Pluto is normally reached
//! over a USB 2.0 Ethernet gadget, which will not carry a megasample-per-second
//! stream in both directions at once, so by default receive is torn down for
//! the length of an over and the whole link is available to transmit: the same
//! trade the HPSDR backend makes.
//!
//! [`PlutoConfig::full_duplex`] takes that arbitration out, for a board with
//! real Ethernet behind it (a LibreSDR, a Pluto on a gigabit adapter). The two
//! buffers then stay open together and each thread reads its own socket, which
//! is what the three-connection layout above was already built for — and the
//! two buffers are two different IIO devices (`cf-ad9361-lpc` and
//! `cf-ad9361-dds-core-lpc`), so a per-device lock in the server does not
//! serialise them either. It is the operator's decision because only they can
//! see the link: the symptom of getting it wrong is not a refusal but a
//! transmit buffer that runs dry, which goes on the air as a chopped envelope.

/// key. Issue #135 measured that at two to three seconds against an unkey that
/// was instant, and the two things in front of it are why:
///
/// * **The transmit oscillator.** Writing it makes the AD9361 force its state
///   machine to ALERT, retune the synthesiser and calibrate the transmit
///   quadrature before restoring the state — the better part of a second, and
///   it used to be paid on *every* key-up even when the dial had not moved
///   since the last one. So the frequency actually in force is remembered and
///   an over that does not need it moved skips the write, which is what
///   `LimeHandle::tx_begin` does with its own slow call next door.
/// * **Waiting for the receive buffer to close.** Half a second at worst, and
///   the chip does not need it: the state machine leaving receive is what
///   silences that direction. It is the *link* that cannot carry both, and only
///   the transmit buffer opening below cares about that — so the wait now sits
///   behind the T/R switch instead of in front of it.
///
/// The DDS step is the one that cannot be skipped: the transmit path is fed by
/// on-chip tone generators unless they are explicitly zeroed, and a Pluto that
/// skips it puts out a steady carrier pair at full power instead of the
/// modulation. `open` zeroes them too, so this is the cheap re-assertion and
/// not the only one.
