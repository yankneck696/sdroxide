//! An in-process `iiod` that a real [`PlutoHandle`] is driven against.
//!
//! This backend was written without a Pluto to test it on, which makes this the
//! main defence: it exercises the actual client — three connections, the
//! control thread, the receive decoder, the transmit encoder — against a server
//! that answers the way libiio's own daemon documents.
//!
//! Two things it deliberately does *not* do:
//!
//! - It does not use this crate's encoder to build the samples it serves. A
//!   self-consistent encode/decode pair passes its own test while both are
//!   wrong; the bytes below are written out by hand from the AD9361 wire format
//!   (12 significant bits, two's complement, little-endian, in a 16-bit slot).
//! - It does not prove the framing is what a real `iiod` produces. That is a
//!   claim about hardware, and only hardware can settle it — see the trace's
//!   `first READBUF chunk` line.
