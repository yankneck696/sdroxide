//! The main window's application state and its behaviour.
//!
//! [`SdroxideApp`] is one large struct — everything the window draws is a
//! function of it, and egui redraws all of it every frame — so splitting the
//! state up would only scatter it. What *is* split is the behaviour: this
//! module holds the state and its constructor, and each submodule holds the
//! `impl SdroxideApp` methods for one part of the window:
//!
//! - [`frame`] — the per-frame loop: drain engine events, lay the window out.
//! - [`top_bar`] — the control strip along the top (VFO, filter, TX, display).
//! - [`spectrum`] — panadapter/waterfall config and the overlays drawn on it.
//! - [`panels`] — the bottom panel, one submodule per operating mode.
//! - [`settings`] — the Settings dialog, one submodule per tab.
//! - [`spots`], [`logbook`], [`awards`], [`net`] — the network cockpit.
//! - [`windows`], [`solar`] — the remaining overlays and the 3D view's feed.
//! - [`persist`], [`util`] — on-disk state and small shared helpers.
//!
//! Submodules are descendants of this one, so they reach the private fields
//! below directly; what they expose *to each other* is marked
//! `pub(in crate::app)`, which is as wide as anything here ever gets.
