/// Bump on any incompatible change to the message enums (this includes the

/// v3: `QsoRecord` gained `id` + `comment` fields.
/// v4: added `ServerMsg::SkimmerSpots` + `Command::SetSkimmerEnabled` + a
/// `RadioState.skimmer_enabled` field.
/// v5: added SSTV — `Mode::Sstv`, `ServerMsg::Sstv*`, and
/// `Command::SstvTx`/`SstvSetMode`.
/// v6: added audio noise reduction + auto-notch — `Command::SetNoiseReduction`,
/// `Command::SetAutoNotch`, and `RxState.noise_reduction` / `RxState.auto_notch`.
/// v7: added keyboard modes Olivia/Thor/FSQ — new `Mode` variants, `DigiConfig`
/// submode fields (Olivia tones/bw, THOR submode, FSQ speed/call), `DigiStatus`
/// FSQ heard-list + directed-message fields, and a mode-agnostic digi image path
/// (`Command::DigiImageTx` / `RadioEvent::DigiImage` for the FSQ image sub-mode).
/// v8: added the audio recorder — `Command::SetRecording` and
/// `RadioState.recording` / `RadioState.recording_file`.
/// v9: FT8/FT4 QSO handling — `QsoStep::WaitCq` / `Confirming` and
/// `Command::DigiStartQso.wait_for_cq`.
/// v10: neural (RNNoise) noise reduction — new `NrLevel::Ai{Low,Med,High}`
/// variants can appear in `RxState.noise_reduction`.
/// v11: network cockpit — spot feeds, callsign lookup, and uploads. New
/// `Command::SetNetworkConfig`/`SpotDialHint`/`LookupCallsign`/`UploadQso`/
/// `SyncConfirmations` and `ServerMsg::Spots`/`NetStatus`/`CallsignResult`/
/// `Upload`/`Confirmations`, plus new `QsoRecord` fields.
/// v12: per-kind skimmer control — `RadioState.skimmer_enabled` became
/// `RadioState.skimmer: SkimmerSettings` (CW/PSK/RTTY enables + squelch) and
/// `Command::SetSkimmerEnabled` became `Command::SetSkimmerConfig`.
/// v13: built-in TCI server — `Command::SetTciServerConfig` and
/// `ServerMsg::TciServerStatus`.
/// v14: FreeDV Reporter — new `SpotKind::FreeDv` (extends the postcard
/// discriminant space of `ServerMsg::Spots`) and `NetworkConfig`'s new
/// `freedv_reporter` field. `NetworkConfig` also lost `my_call`/`my_grid`: the
/// operator identity is `DigiConfig`'s alone, so both ends must agree on the
/// shape `Command::SetNetworkConfig` carries.
/// v15: built-in Hamlib rigctld server — `Command::SetRigctldConfig` and
/// `ServerMsg::RigctldStatus` (both extend the postcard discriminant space).
/// v16: FT8 message handling and reporting. `Decode` gained `cq_dx` and
/// `free_text`, `TranscriptLine` gained `overheard`, and `PskConfig` gained the
/// upload fields — postcard is not self-describing, so every added field
/// changes the layout of the messages carrying them. Also new:
/// `Command::SetWsjtxConfig` (WSJT-X UDP broadcast).
/// v17: manual FT8 message control — `Command::DigiSetStep` and
/// `Command::DigiSendText` (both extend the postcard discriminant space).
/// v18: FT8 transmit watchdog — `DigiStatus.tx_watchdog` plus `DigiConfig`'s
/// `tx_watchdog_min` / `max_tx_repeats`, which both ends must agree on.
/// v19: voice keyer — `Command::VoiceRecord`/`VoicePlay`/`VoicePreview`/
/// `VoiceClear`/`VoiceRename` and `ServerMsg::VoiceStatus` (both extend the
/// postcard discriminant space).
/// v20: Hellschreiber — `ServerMsg::HellColumns` plus `DigiConfig`'s
/// `hell_variant` / `hell_rx_agc`, which both ends must agree on because
/// `DigiStatus` carries the config. (`Mode::Hell` alone would have been
/// compatible: it is appended to the enum, so no existing discriminant moves.)
/// v21: FT8 DXpedition mode — `DigiConfig`'s `dxped_mode` / `fox_slots`,
/// `DigiStatus.fox_queue`, and `Decode.rr73_to` (the RR73 half of a Fox
/// message, which is how a Hound learns its contact completed). Postcard is not
/// self-describing, so both ends must agree on every one of those fields.
/// v22: clock-offset monitoring — `DigiStatus.clock_offset_s`.
/// v23: directed CQs — `Decode.cq_dx` became `Decode.cq_to`, the modifier
/// itself (`DX`, `EU`, `JA`, `POTA`, …) rather than a single DX flag.
/// v24: the FT8/FT4 call queue — `Command::DigiQueueAdd`/`DigiQueueRemove` and
/// `DigiStatus.call_queue`.
/// v25: automatic transmit-frequency choice — `DigiConfig.auto_tx_freq`.
/// v26: RIFP (draft-dulaunoy-rifp-00) — `Mode::Rifp` and `Band::M70` (both
/// appended, so no existing discriminant moves), `Command::RifpTx` /
/// `RifpDropSession`, `ServerMsg::RifpRows` / `RifpImage` / `RifpStatus`, and
/// `DigiConfig`'s `rifp_*` fields, which both ends must agree on because
/// `DigiStatus` carries the config.
/// v27: WFM broadcast stereo — `RxState.wfm_stereo`, `Meters.stereo` and
/// `Command::SetWfmStereo`. The command is appended so no existing discriminant
/// moves, but postcard is not self-describing, so the two added struct fields
/// change the layout of every message carrying `RadioState` or `Meters`.
/// v28: JS8 — `Mode::Js8`, the `js8_*` fields on `DigiConfig`, and
/// `DigiStatus.js8` carrying the heard list, the reassembled conversation and
/// transmit-queue progress. No message enum gained a variant, but postcard is
/// not self-describing and the added struct fields change the layout of every
/// message carrying `DigiConfig` or `DigiStatus`.
/// v29: JS8 beaconing — `DigiConfig`'s `js8_hb_ack` (answer a heard heartbeat
/// with a signal report) and `js8_hb_anywhere` (beacon on the working frequency
/// instead of the 500–1000 Hz sub-band), plus `Js8Status.hb_hz`, the frequency
/// the last beacon actually went out on. `Js8Status.next_hb_in_s` is now
/// populated rather than always `None`, which is a behaviour change but not a
/// layout one. Both ends must agree on the three added fields, postcard being
/// what it is.
/// v30: broadcast station labels — new `SpotKind::Broadcast`, which extends the
/// postcard discriminant space of `ServerMsg::Spots` exactly as `FreeDv` did in
/// v14. The engine never emits it (the stations are synthesised client-side from
/// a bundled table), but the enum both ends decode has changed shape, so they
/// must agree on it.
/// v31: the full-band panadapter — a new `ServerMsg::WideSpectrum`, carrying an
/// ordinary `SpectrumFrame` on its own lane. Appended at the end of the enum so
/// no existing postcard discriminant moves, but an older client cannot decode
/// the new message, so the handshake has to reject it.
/// v32: engine notices reach remote clients — a new `ServerMsg::Notice`,
/// likewise appended at the end. What a notice says is the operator's business
/// wherever they are sitting: a radio refusing a tune, or an interface that has
/// dropped and is reconnecting, is not a local-console detail.
/// v33: the picture stores moved server-side — five new `ServerMsg`s
/// (`ImagePresets`, `ImageSlotSource`, `ImageListing`, `ImageFile`,
/// `ImageSaved`) and six new `Command`s (`ImageSetSlot`, `ImageClearSlot`,
/// `ImageSetMessage`, `ImageGetSlot`, `ImageList`, `ImageGet`), all appended so
/// no existing discriminant moves. The transmit slots, their overlay messages
/// and the received galleries used to be client state, which meant a browser
/// tab and the console attached to the same radio disagreed about both — and
/// the browser, having no filesystem, had neither. They belong to the radio:
/// the engine owns the files and hands out metadata, thumbnails and pixels on
/// request. Composition stays client-side, and transmit still rides the
/// existing `SstvTx` / `RifpTx`.
/// v34: the station configuration reaches remote clients — two new `ServerMsg`s
/// (`StationConfig`, `TleSubStatus`) and two new `Command`s (`SetSatConfig`,
/// `RefreshTleSubs`), all appended so no existing discriminant moves. The
/// network cockpit, the two built-in servers, the WSJT-X broadcast and the
/// satellite additions all describe the *station*, and all of them are files in
/// the engine host's config directory. A remote settings dialog used to read
/// its own machine's copy — nonexistent in a browser — so those tabs opened on
/// defaults, and pressing APPLY wrote the defaults back over the operator's
/// real configuration. The engine announces them instead, and the server caches
/// and replays them like the digi config.
/// v35: received pictures can be deleted — one new `ServerMsg` (`ImageDeleted`)
/// and one new `Command` (`ImageDelete`), both appended so no existing
/// discriminant moves. The store is on the engine host, so until now the only
/// way to clear out a season of half-decoded charts and noise-only frames was to
/// go to that machine with a file manager; a browser tab could not do it at all.
/// The deletion is broadcast rather than answered, because a picture that has
/// gone is gone from every gallery, not just the one that asked.
/// v36: sign-in — one new `ClientMsg` (`Auth`) and two new `ServerMsg`s
/// (`AuthRequired`, `AuthRejected`), all appended so no existing discriminant
/// moves. A server with credentials configured answers `Hello` with
/// `AuthRequired` instead of `HelloAck` and waits; everything that used to
/// happen next happens after the credentials are accepted. The version still
/// has to be bumped despite the appends: a v35 client cannot decode
/// `AuthRequired`, so it would report a protocol error rather than the truth,
/// which is that it needs a password and cannot ask for one.
/// v37: manual audio gain — `RxState.manual_gain_db` and a new
/// `Command::SetManualGain`, which is *not* appended: it sits with the other
/// receiver commands, so the discriminants after it move. Both ends must agree
/// on the added field anyway, postcard not being self-describing, so the
/// version has to be bumped either way. AGC off used to mean unity gain on the
/// demodulator's own output, which for an SSB signal 60 dB down is silence at
/// any volume setting; it now means this fixed gain instead.
/// v38: a finished FT8/FT4 contact says so — `TranscriptLine` gained `done`,
/// the flag on the line that marks the QSO complete and logged. Appended to the
/// struct, but postcard is not self-describing, so every message carrying a
/// `DigiStatus` changes layout and both ends have to agree on the field.
/// v39: `QsoStep::Done` is gone. Nothing ever set it — `Confirming` is the
/// state a finished contact sits in — so no engine has ever put it on the wire.
/// It was the last variant, so no surviving discriminant moves, but the enum
/// both ends decode has changed shape and this codebase bumps for that.
/// v40: sub-audible squelch signalling on NFM — `Meters.tone` carries the CTCSS
/// tone or DCS code being received, `RxState.tone_sql` the one the operator
/// requires before the audio gate opens, and `Command::SetToneSquelch` sets it.
/// The command is appended, so no surviving discriminant moves, but postcard is
/// not self-describing and the two added struct fields change the layout of
/// every message carrying `RadioState` or `Meters`.
/// v41: the frequency scanner — `RadioState.scan` says whether it is running
/// and whether it has stopped on something, `RadioEvent::Scanner` carries the
/// settings the way `Memories` carries the memory list, and four appended
/// commands (`SetScannerConfig`, `SetScanning`, `ScanNext`, `ScanSkip`) drive
/// it. The commands are appended, but the added `RadioState` field changes the
/// layout of every message carrying one, postcard not being self-describing.
/// v42: recording both sides of the QSO (RX left, TX right) instead of just
/// the receiver, plus an optional mono downmix — `Command::SetRecordingMono`
/// (appended) and `RadioState.recording_mono` (changes the layout of every
/// message carrying `RadioState`).
/// v43: two more noise-reduction engines. `NrLevel` gained
/// `Spec{Low,Med,High}` (a Rust port of libspecbleach's adaptive denoiser) and
/// `Df{Low,Med,High}` (DeepFilterNet3), both appended so no surviving
/// discriminant moves — but a v42 client cannot decode discriminants 7..12 at
/// all, so it would report a protocol error rather than the truth, which is
/// that the operator picked an engine it has never heard of. The `Ai*`
/// variants were also renamed `Rnn*`, which the wire cannot see (postcard is
/// positional and this enum is persisted nowhere else) but the labels can: the
/// chip reads "NR RNN Med" where it read "NR AI Med".
/// v44: WSPR. `Mode::Wspr` is appended, as is `SpotKind::Wspr`, so no surviving
/// discriminant moves — but `DigiConfig` gained five fields and `DigiStatus` a
/// `wspr: Option<WsprStatus>`, and postcard is not self-describing, so every
/// message carrying either changes layout and both ends have to agree. The new
/// `ServerMsg::WsprSpots` carries what a slot decoded: a WSPR reception is a
/// measurement of a path rather than a message somebody sent, so it travels as
/// its own event instead of being squeezed into `Decode`. `WsprStatus` also
/// carries `tx_blocked`, the engine's own answer to "can this station transmit
/// as configured" — the panel used to work that out for itself and got it
/// wrong, and one authority is the point.
/// v45: the CW skimmer's decoder is the operator's choice. `SkimmerSettings`
/// gained `cw_decoder` (DeepCW or the envelope-timing decoder) and `cw_slots`
/// (how many stations the neural one reads at once), so a receiver that cannot
/// spare the cores for a Conformer per station can still skim. Both are
/// appended, but `SkimmerSettings` is a field of `RadioState` as well as the
/// payload of `Command::SetSkimmerConfig`, and postcard is not self-describing:
/// the layout of every state broadcast changes and both ends have to agree.
/// v46: memory folders — `MemoryChannel` gained `folder`, which changes the
/// layout of every `Memories` message, postcard not being self-describing. The
/// folder list itself rides the new `ServerMsg::MemoryFolders` (appended last,
/// so no surviving discriminant moves), and four appended `Command`s
/// (`CreateMemoryFolder` / `RenameMemoryFolder` / `DeleteMemoryFolder` /
/// `MoveMemoryToFolder`) manage them.
/// v47: an RTTY memory carries its modem setup — `MemoryChannel` gained
/// `rtty: Option<RttyMemory>` (baud / shift / reverse / AFC), captured when a
/// memory is stored in RTTY mode and re-applied on recall. Changes the layout
/// of every `Memories` message, postcard not being self-describing.
/// v48: the satellite lock. Two appended `Command`s (`SetSatLock`,
/// `SetRotatorConfig`) and two appended `ServerMsg`s (`SatTrack`,
/// `RotatorStatus`), so no surviving discriminant moves — but `SatLink` gained
/// `inverting` and `StationConfig` gained `rotator`, and postcard is not
/// self-describing, so every message carrying either (`SetSatConfig`, the
/// `StationConfig` bundle) changes layout and both ends have to agree.
///
/// v49: `DeviceCaps` gained `shared_lo_rx` (a Pluto 2R2T's chains share one
/// LO). Appended field, but postcard is not self-describing, so every message
/// carrying capabilities changes layout and both ends have to agree.
/// v50: the band plan became data. `StationConfig` gained `region` (which of
/// the three IARU regions the station is in) and `band_plan` (the edges and
/// sub-segments themselves, from the engine machine's `bandplan.json`), so the
/// bundle changes layout and both ends have to agree. `Command::SetRegion` and
/// `Command::ReloadBandPlan` are appended last, so no surviving discriminant
/// moves.
/// v51: the interface configuration reaches remote clients — a new
/// `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and a new `Command::SetRadioConfig`, both appended
/// last, so no surviving discriminant moves. What an SDR can be told about
/// itself is not all expressible as a gain stage: an RTL-SDR's AGC mode, its
/// ppm correction, its HF path and its bias tee ride `SetGain` pseudo-elements
/// to the running device, but the panel that drives them reads and writes
/// `radio.json` — a file in the engine host's config directory, which a remote
/// client had no copy of and was therefore shown "only available in the native
/// app" instead of. A headless server's dongle could only be configured by
/// editing that file by hand and restarting. The engine announces it instead,
/// and the server caches and replays it like the station config. The version
/// still has to be bumped despite the appends: a v50 client cannot decode the
/// announcement, so it would report a protocol error rather than the truth,
/// which is that the server is offering it something it has never heard of.
/// v52: Winlink radio email. Five appended `Command`s (`WinlinkConnect`,
/// `MailList`, `MailGet`, `MailCompose`, `MailDelete`, `MailMove`) and five
/// appended `ServerMsg`s (`WinlinkStatus`, `MailListing`, `MailMessage`,
/// `MailSaved`, `MailDeleted`), so no surviving discriminant moves — but
/// `NetworkConfig` gained `winlink`, and postcard is not self-describing, so
/// every message carrying it changes layout and both ends have to agree. The
/// mailbox itself stays on the engine host and is read a page and a message at
/// a time, like the picture store: mirroring a mailbox with attachments in it
/// to every client on connect is not something a phone link would survive.
/// v53: AX.25 packet radio. Two appended `Mode` variants — `Packet` (VHF/UHF
/// FM) and `PacketHf` (HF sideband) — so no surviving discriminant moves and a
/// v52 client decodes every mode it already knew. The bump is for the other
/// direction: a v53 engine on a packet mode sends a discriminant a v52 client
/// has never heard of, and postcard is not self-describing, so what it would
/// report is a protocol error rather than the truth. Same reasoning as v51's.
/// `DigiConfig` also gained the `packet_*` settings and `DigiStatus` an
/// `Option<PacketStatus>` carrying the heard list, which changes the layout of
/// every message either of them rides in — the same reason v52 had to bump for
/// `NetworkConfig`. The heard list is capped (`PACKET_HEARD_MAX`) and travels
/// whole rather than as a delta: it is a rolling view of a busy channel, not a
/// log, and a client that reconnects wants what is on the air now.
/// `WinlinkConfig` also gained `lane`, `gateway` and `gateway_via`, so the
/// operator picks the radio lane in settings rather than the client picking it
/// per connect — which keeps `Command::WinlinkConnect` unchanged and means an
/// older client still forwards by telnet instead of failing to encode a command
/// it has never heard of.
/// v54: the 4 m band. `Band::M4` is appended to the enum, so no postcard
/// discriminant moves and every band stack and memory already on disk still
/// decodes — but `Band::ALL` puts it between 6 m and 2 m, where it belongs on
/// screen, and that list's *position* is what the propagation messages index by
/// (`SolarServerMsg`'s per-band planes, and the band masks the globe and map
/// carry). A v53 client would file 2 m's plane under 4 m and 70 cm's under 2 m,
/// which is the one thing a version byte exists to prevent.
/// v55: SpyServer, as two interfaces. `Backend::SpyServer` and
/// `Backend::SpyServerVfo` are appended so no existing discriminant moves, and
/// `RadioConfig` gained a `spyserver` and a `spyserver_vfo` block. Both halves
/// force the bump, for the two reasons v51 and v53 already set out: a new
/// `Backend` discriminant is a value a v54 client has never heard of, and two
/// new `RadioConfig` fields change the layout of every message that struct
/// rides in — which is `ServerMsg::RadioConfig`, the message the settings
/// dialog is built from. Postcard is not self-describing, so a v54 client
/// would not fail to find them; it would decode the fields after them from the
/// wrong offset.
/// v56: device questions travel. A new `ClientMsg::Probe` and a new
/// `ServerMsg::ProbeAnswer`, both appended last, so no surviving discriminant
/// moves. Every other setting in `radio.json` describes a device and therefore
/// means the same thing wherever it is read; the discovery controls beside them
/// ask about a *machine* — what is on its USB bus, which serial ports it has,
/// what a broadcast finds on its network, which sound cards the rig could be
/// plugged into — and a client that answered those locally would be describing
/// the wrong computer. So they were greyed out, and with them the interface
/// selector: with no list to pick from there was nothing to choose. Now the
/// question is asked of the machine the radio is attached to and the answer
/// comes back over the session, which is what makes changing the radio on a
/// `--server` instance possible from a remote or browser client at all. The
/// version bump is for the usual reason: a v55 client cannot decode an answer
/// it has never heard of, and would report a protocol error instead of the
/// truth, which is that the server is offering it something new. `ServerMsg`
/// also gained `Capabilities`, appended after it: with the interface
/// changeable from a client, the radio a session is talking to can become a
/// different one mid-session, and what it can do has to follow.
///
/// **57** — a station serves every radio in its roster, each on its own
/// address, so a session now says which radio it is on and what else the
/// station has: [`ServerMsg::Radios`], sent once, right after `HelloAck`.
/// Without it a client could reach a second radio only if somebody typed its
/// address in by hand, and could never put the station's radios in tabs the
/// way it does with the ones plugged into this machine.
/// **58** — RDS/RBDS on WFM broadcast: [`ServerMsg::Rds`], appended last. A
/// remote client gets the station name, programme type, radio text and
/// now-playing tags the same way the local one does, because the decoding
/// happens where the radio is and only the result travels. Cached and replayed
/// on connect like the other announced-once state: the station being listened to
/// is a *condition*, not an event, and a browser tab that attaches after the
/// dial stopped moving would otherwise sit blank until the text next changed.
///
/// **59** — an RMS gateway carries its own speed and channel. `WinlinkConfig`
/// gained `gateway_baud` and `gateway_freq_hz`, so picking a 9600 gateway from
/// the list calls it at 9600 instead of in silence at 1200. `WinlinkConfig`
/// travels inside `Command::SetNetworkConfig`, and postcard is not
/// self-describing: two appended fields shift every byte after them, so a v58
/// client and a v59 server would disagree about where the gateway list starts.
/// `#[serde(default)]` covers the config file on disk, not the wire — hence
/// the bump.
///
/// **60** — the microwave bands: 1.25 m and 33 cm (Region 2's alone, like 4 m is
/// Region 1's), and 23 cm, 13 cm, 9 cm and 6 cm. `Band::M125`, `Band::Cm33`,
/// `Band::Cm23`, `Band::Cm13`, `Band::Cm9` and `Band::Cm6` are appended to the
/// enum, so no postcard discriminant moves and every band stack and memory
/// already on disk still decodes. The bump is for the same reason v54's was:
/// `Band::ALL` puts each new band where it belongs on screen — 1.25 m between
/// 2 m and 70 cm, the rest above it — and that list's *position* is what the
/// propagation messages index by (`SolarServerMsg`'s per-band planes, and the
/// band masks the globe and the flat map carry). A v59 client would file 70 cm's
/// plane under 1.25 m and every plane above it one band low.
///
/// **61** — a second radio used as this one's panadapter. `DeviceCaps` gained
/// `rx_audio_external` and `RadioConfig` gained a whole `panadapter` block, and
/// both travel over the wire — `DeviceCaps` in `ServerMsg::Capabilities`,
/// `RadioConfig` in `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig`.
/// Both are appended last, so nothing already on disk moves, but postcard is
/// positional and not self-describing: a v60 client reading a v61
/// `RadioConfig` would run off the end of the message, and `#[serde(default)]`
/// covers the file, not the stream.
///
/// **62** — the panadapter's gestures say so. `Command::TuneInSpan` is appended
/// last, so no surviving discriminant moves, but a v61 engine would answer a
/// command it cannot decode with a protocol error. It separates tuning inside
/// the span already on screen (click, drag, wheel on the panadapter) from
/// setting the dial (`Command::SetVfo` — the readout, a memory, an external
/// controller), which are the same thing on an SDR and are not on a rig whose
/// own synthesiser is the centre of what we capture. (The semantic split has
/// since been retired — the engine answers both commands identically, see
/// `Command::TuneInSpan` — but the discriminant is on the wire and stays.)
///
/// **63** — the ISM decoder. `RadioState` gained an `ism` block, which puts it in
/// *every* state broadcast, so this is not an append a v62 client can survive:
/// it would run off the end of the first state message it received. The new
/// `ServerMsg::IsmReports` / `IsmStatus` and `Command::SetIsmConfig` are appended
/// last as usual. `IsmSettings` carries its per-family switches as a bitmask
/// rather than a fixed-length array precisely so that the *next* protocol family
/// added does not force this bump again.
///
/// **64** — the ELAD backend. `Backend`, `DeviceProbe`, `ProbeAnswer` and
/// `ReportKind` each gained a variant and `RadioConfig` an `elad` block. All
/// appends, but a v63 client asked to decode the new `Backend::Elad` — or handed
/// a `RadioConfig` with one more field on the end — has nowhere to put it, and
/// the config is what a client reads to draw the settings dialog.
///
/// **65** — the LimeSDR backend and LimeRFE control. `Backend`, `DeviceProbe`,
/// `ProbeAnswer` and `ReportKind` each gained a variant and `RadioConfig` a
/// `lime` block, which carries a nested `LimeRfeConfig` of its own. Appends
/// again, and again not survivable: a v64 client handed a `RadioConfig` with
/// the new block on the end stops at the wrong byte, and the LimeRFE settings
/// it cannot decode are the ones that decide whether an amplifier is switched
/// into the transmit path.
///
/// **66** — the transmit tone can be held. `DigiConfig` gained `hold_tx_freq`,
/// and `DigiConfig` travels inside `DigiStatus`, so this is not an append a v65
/// client can survive: postcard is positional and every field after it shifts.
/// `#[serde(default)]` covers the config file on disk, not the wire. The engine
/// gained `Settings.tx_guard_offset`, but that is local and not on the wire.
///
/// **67** — the transmit tone is remembered per band. `DigiConfig` gained
/// `tx_audio_hz`, a map from `Band` to the offset last chosen there, and the
/// same reasoning as 66 applies unchanged: it sits inside `DigiStatus`,
/// postcard is positional, and a v66 client reading a v67 status runs into the
/// wrong field. `#[serde(default)]` again covers the config file and not the
/// wire. The engine's `digi_tx_band` is local state and is not sent.
///
/// **68** — the rig's own power-output meter. `TxMeters` gained `po`, a
/// `0.0..=1.0` fraction of the rig's own scale, and `TxMeters` is not the last
/// field of `Meters`: `stereo` and `tone` follow it. So this is not even an
/// append a client can stop short of — every byte after `tx` shifts, and a v67
/// client handed a v68 `Meters` with the transmitter keyed reads the new
/// `Option` tag as `stereo` and then runs off the end of the message. Same
/// reasoning as v27 and v40, which bumped for exactly this struct.
///
/// The ALC reading that landed alongside it is NOT a wire change: it went into
/// `TxTelemetry`, which the engine folds into `TxMeters::alc` — an existing
/// field — and which never leaves the process on its own.
///
/// **69** — the SoapySDR settings panel. `DeviceCaps` gained `bandwidths`,
/// `bandwidth_ranges` and `settings`, so that a driver's own controls can be
/// drawn from what the device says about itself rather than from per-driver
/// code. They are appended last and `#[serde(default)]`, but postcard is not
/// self-describing and `DeviceCaps` is sent whole: a v68 client would stop
/// reading where the struct used to end and treat the remainder as the next
/// message. Same reasoning as every other `DeviceCaps` append.

/// **70** — the flrig CAT family. `CatConfig` gained `flrig_addr` and

/// **71** — the serial CI-V scope (issue #96 on USB). `CatConfig` gained

///
/// **72** — the embedded rtl_433 ISM decoders. Four changes, any one of which

/// reuses `IsmReports`, `IsmStatus` and `SetIsmConfig`.
///
/// **73** — the station's roster is editable from a client. Three appended
/// `ClientMsg`s (`AddRadio`, `RemoveRadio`, `RenameRadio`), which alone would

///
/// **74** — HamQTH joins eQSL/QRZ/Club Log as an upload target. Two appended
/// fields and two appended variants, and the fields are what force the bump:

///
/// **75** — a radio's power switch reaches a client. `RadioInfo` gained
/// `enabled`, and it rides inside `ServerMsg::Radios` ahead of that message's

/// did not was doing it from away, which meant the browser client — a headless
/// station's *only* screen — could not put a radio down and pick it back up.
///
/// **76** — a stored memory can be edited (issue #138).
/// `Command::EditMemory` carries the channel's new name, dial and mode.

///
/// The sort that landed with it is not on the wire at all: which order a

///
/// **77** — repeater operation (issue #137). [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`]
/// carries a `RepeaterState`: the transmit shift, the CTCSS/DCS tone that goes
/// out under the voice, and the 1750 Hz burst. `Command::SetRepeater` and
/// `Command::ToneBurst` set and fire them, `Command::EditMemory` gained the
/// setup a memory stores, and `MemoryChannel` gained the field it stores it in.
///
/// A field added to a struct in the state, so this is not a variant append that
/// an older peer could simply never be sent: a v76 client decoding a v77 state
/// would read the tail of it as garbage. The handshake is an equality test and
/// catches that before a single frame is exchanged, which is what it is for.
/// **78** — the ISM decoder's rtl_433 lane gained a chosen bandwidth and a
/// fifth band (issue #141). `Rtl433Settings` carries `bandwidth_hz`, which is
/// the width to watch or zero for the band's own, and `Rtl433Status` carries
/// `rate_hz`, the width actually being decoded. Both are fields added to
/// structs — the settings ride in [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`] and the status
/// in an event — so a v77 peer would read the tail of either as garbage, and

///
/// The 345 MHz band itself is not on the wire: it is a row in a table both
/// sides already have.
///
/// **79** — dragging the panadapter past the end of the captured window moves
/// the window (issue #133). [`sdroxide_types::DeviceCaps`] carries
/// `center_is_dial`, which says whether the front end has a centre that can be

///
/// **80** — the banner across the top of a transmitted SSTV/RIFP picture is

/// `sstv_banner_ink` and `sstv_banner_height`: what the strip prints at each
/// end, what colour it and its text are, and how tall it is. The two texts
/// carry `{call}` / `{grid}` / `{version}` placeholders, resolved by whichever
/// client composes the picture.
///
/// On the station rather than in this screen's `UiSettings`, where the

///
/// **81** — the HydraSDR RFOne is an interface of its own (issue #144).
/// [`sdroxide_types::Backend`] gained `HydraSdr` and
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`] a `hydrasdr` block, with `DeviceProbe`,
/// `ProbeAnswer` and `ReportKind` gaining the variants that enumerate one and

///
/// A field appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v80 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the

/// one); the config block is not.
///
/// **82** — a LimeSDR's second receive chain can carry a second aerial, and
/// the two are combined (issue #98). [`sdroxide_types::LimeConfig`] gained an
/// `aux` block — [`sdroxide_types::LimeAuxConfig`] — carrying what the chain is

/// hold.
///
/// A field appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v81 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
/// **83** — that second chain can instead carry a directional coupler, and
/// linearise the transmitter from a sample of what it emitted — PureSignal
/// (issue #98). [`sdroxide_types::LimeAuxRole`] gained a `PureSignal` variant
/// and [`sdroxide_types::LimeAuxConfig`] the `ps_bins`, `ps_rate` and
/// `ps_frozen` that drive the correction.
///
/// Fields appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v82 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the

/// would have been survivable on its own; the fields are not.
///
/// **84** — a PlutoSDR can key an external amplifier, LNA or transmit-receive
/// switch from its own GPO pins (issue #135). [`sdroxide_types::PlutoConfig`]
/// gained `duplex` ([`sdroxide_types::PlutoDuplex`]) and `ptt_gpo`
/// ([`sdroxide_types::PlutoPtt`]): which duplex the AD9361's enable state
/// machine runs in, and which pair of pins follows the radio.
///
/// Fields appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v83 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
/// v85: DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) — `Mode::Drm`, `ServerMsg::Drm` carrying
/// `DrmStatus`, and `Command::SetDrmService` / `SetDrmConstellation`. All are
/// appended, so no existing discriminant moves.
///
/// **86** — a rig's I/Q sound card gets the front-end correction every other
/// quadrature interface here already had (issue #147).
/// [`sdroxide_types::CatConfig`] gained `iq_correction` and `iq_dc_block_hz`:
/// whether the mirror image and the DC spike are cancelled, and how wide a
/// notch to take out of the centre.
///
/// Fields in the radio configuration, which rides in both a command and an
/// event, so a v85 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// **87** — an RSPduo can run *both* of its tuners and combine them, the same
/// way a LimeSDR's second chain is combined at v82 (issue #153).
/// [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayConfig`] gained a `diversity` block —
/// [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayDuo`] — carrying whether the second tuner
/// runs at all, its own two gains, and the adaptive filter's mode, length,
/// rate and hold.
///
/// A field appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v86 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// **88** — QRP Labs radios (QMX, QMX+, QDX) are a CAT family of their own
/// (issue #95). [`sdroxide_types::CatFamily`] gained a trailing `QrpLabs`
/// variant.
///
/// Nothing moved: postcard numbers variants by declaration index and the new
/// one went on the end, so every existing family keeps its number and a v87
/// peer's own configuration still round-trips. What forces the bump is the
/// other direction — a v87 client handed `QrpLabs` has no such variant to put
/// it in, and postcard is not self-describing, so it does not fail on the field
/// but on everything after it. Same reasoning as v72's `IsmProtocol` append.
///
/// **89** — APRS is a mode of its own (issue #150). Three appends, all at the
/// tail of their type: [`sdroxide_types::Mode`] gained `Aprs`,
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gained `AprsBeacon` and `AprsSendMessage`, and
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiStatus`] gained an `aprs` field carrying the map, the
/// messages and the channel.
///
/// The `Mode` append is the one that forces the bump, and it is the same trap
/// as v88's: postcard numbers variants by declaration index, so every existing
/// mode keeps its number — but a v88 client handed `Aprs` has no variant to
/// decode it into and desynchronises on everything after it, rather than
/// failing on the field itself.
///
/// **90** — an RSPduo's two tuners can be two *radios* rather than two aerials
/// combined, and the diversity filter's controls have moved to the main strip
/// (issue #165). [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayDuo`] gained `role`
/// ([`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayDuoRole`]): whether the second tuner is combined
/// with the first or handed to a radio of its own.
/// [`sdroxide_types::DeviceCaps`] gained `diversity`, which is what tells the
/// strip that a filter is running without it having to know which backend has
/// one.
///
/// Fields appended to the radio configuration and to the capabilities. Both
/// ride the wire — the configuration in a command and an event, the
/// capabilities in an event of their own — so a v89 peer would read the tail
/// of any of them as garbage; the handshake's equality test is what stops it
/// trying.
///
/// The block itself is written under a new name with this version — `duo`
/// rather than `diversity`, since combining is no longer all it does — which
/// is invisible here: postcard numbers fields by position and never sends a
/// name. It is `radio.json` that the old name matters to, and a serde alias
/// keeps those files loading.
///
/// **91** — the panadapter's horizontal resolution is the client's to ask for
/// (issue #172). [`sdroxide_types::SpectrumConfig`] gained `bins`: how many
/// columns the emitted frames carry, which until now was a constant 2048 on
/// both sides of the wire and so never needed saying.
///
/// It is the *client* that knows the number — its screen's pixel width and its
/// own renderer's limits — so it has to travel, and it travels in the same
/// command as the FFT size and the frame rate. Inserted after `fft_size`
/// rather than appended, because it belongs next to it: postcard numbers
/// fields by position, so a v90 peer would read `bins` as `fps` and everything
/// after it as garbage either way. The handshake's equality test is what stops
/// it trying.
///
/// **92** — the waterfall's *time* axis is the client's to ask for too, and the
/// engine now clocks it. [`sdroxide_types::SpectrumConfig`] gained
/// `rows_per_sec`, and [`sdroxide_types::SpectrumFrame`] gained `rows`: the
/// waterfall lines the engine clocked since the last frame, each of them the
/// per-bin peak over its own slice of time.
///
/// Until now a frame *was* a row, so the waterfall could not advance faster
/// than the screen redrew — a fast scroll simply wrote the same numbers two or
/// three times and the operator saw lines two or three pixels tall, while a
/// front end streaming megahertz had hundreds of transforms a second going
/// spare. The two rates are now separate all the way down the wire.
///
/// The frame also gained `rows_clocked`, which is not the same as `rows` being
/// non-empty and has to be said separately: below the frame rate most frames
/// carry no rows at all, and a client that read that as "this lane does not
/// clock rows" would scroll them on its own wall clock *as well* and run the
/// waterfall at twice the rate of its own time labels. `false` is the shape for
/// a lane that really cannot clock them — a radio's own sweep, a transmit
/// monitor — and only then does the client scroll on its own.
///
/// All three ride in the frame or the config, both of which cross the wire, and
/// `rows_per_sec` sits after `display_bins` rather than at the tail, so a v91
/// peer would desynchronise on any of them. The handshake's equality test is
/// what stops it trying.
///
/// **93** — the digital modes' transmit-audio level split in two.
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] lost `tx_audio_level` and gained
/// `tx_audio_level_fm` and `tx_audio_level_ssb`: the one number was doing two
/// unrelated jobs — deviation into an FM rig, drive into a sideband rig's
/// modulator — and a level set for 1200 baud packet was quietly taking 8 dB off
/// FT8 as well, which is issue #131's symptom by another road.
///
/// The configuration rides the wire in a command and comes back in an event, so
/// one field becoming two moves everything after it: postcard numbers fields by
/// position, and a v92 peer would read the new sideband level as the field that
/// used to follow and the rest as garbage. The handshake's equality test is what
/// stops it trying. `digi.json` is migrated rather than versioned — the old key
/// carries into both new ones on load, so nobody's signal changes level.
///
/// **94** — packet radio grew an operator's terminal, so the panel needs to know
/// more about the link than the callsign at the far end.
/// [`sdroxide_types::PacketStatus::link`] changes from `Option<String>` to
/// `Option<PacketLink>`: the state machine's own name for where it is, the peer,
/// the digipeater path, the sequence width, the frames outstanding, the retry
/// count against N2, and which of the two things that can drive one link is
/// driving it — the packet panel or the MAIL window. That last one is the answer
/// to "why was I refused", which an operator otherwise has to guess at.
///
/// `term` and `term_partial` are new beside it: the session's lines, and the
/// tail of one that has arrived without its terminator. The tail is carried
/// separately because it is the most important thing on the screen — a BBS
/// prompt has no carriage return after it, so a terminal that printed only whole
/// lines would sit showing nothing while the far end waited for an answer to a
/// question the operator never saw.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gains `PacketConnect`, `PacketSend`,
/// `PacketDisconnect` and `PacketTermClear`, appended for the usual reason, and
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] gains `packet_connect_text`,
/// `packet_connect_via` and `packet_ext_seq` beside the packet settings they
/// belong with rather than at the tail — postcard numbers fields by position and
/// a v93 peer desynchronises on either placement, so they go where they read.
/// The handshake's equality test is what stops it trying. `digi.json` needs no
/// migration: all three carry `#[serde(default)]`, so a config written by v93
/// loads unchanged.
///
/// **95** — the digital modes' transmit-audio level is per mode (issue #186).
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] gains `tx_audio_levels`, a map from
/// [`Mode`](sdroxide_types::Mode) to the level the operator set for it, placed
/// beside the two carrier levels it overrides rather than at the tail — the same
/// reasoning as v94's placement, since postcard numbers fields by position and a
/// v94 peer desynchronises either way. `DigiConfig` rides inside `DigiStatus` and
/// inside `Command::SetDigiConfig`, so this is not an append a v94 client can
/// survive; the handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// The two carrier levels **stay**, as the level for a mode with no entry of its
/// own, which is what makes this the rare wire change that needs no config
/// migration at all: an empty map is exactly v94's behaviour, so nobody's signal
/// changes level on the update, and a mode appended in a later release inherits
/// the level the operator actually runs instead of springing back to full scale.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gains `SetDigiTxLevel`, appended for the usual
/// reason. It carries the mode rather than letting the engine read it off the
/// dial, because the control is a rail dragged while transmitting and a mode
/// change landing mid-drag would otherwise write one mode's level onto another's.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::DeviceCaps`] gains `cw_audio_keyed`, appended: a client has
/// to know whether CW leaves as audio or as text over the control port before it
/// can decide whether that level reaches CW at all.
///
/// **96** — xHE-AAC decoding for DRM. Two changes to `DrmStatus`, which rides in
/// [`ServerMsg::Drm`].
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::DrmCodec`] lost its `Celp` and `Hvxc` variants. Both were
/// withdrawn from the DRM standard and neither can be signalled, and the two
/// slots they occupied now mean Opus and "reserved" — so the old table read an
/// Opus service as CELP. Postcard numbers a fieldless enum by declaration
/// order, so every remaining variant moved: a v95 peer would read xHE-AAC as
/// HVXC.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::DrmService`] gained `codec_supported`, which is not
/// appended but sits beside `codec` where it reads. A locked receiver whose
/// codec has no decoder reports a healthy signal, a service label and silence,
/// and this is the only field that distinguishes that from an audio decode
/// that is merely failing.
/// **97** — converter overload is a reading of its own (issue #173).
/// [`sdroxide_types::Meters`] gained `adc_clip`, the fraction of converter
/// samples sitting at full scale, beside the `adc_peak_dbfs` it completes
/// rather than at the tail — postcard numbers fields by position and a v96 peer
/// desynchronises on either placement, so it goes where it reads.
///
/// `adc_peak_dbfs` was on the wire from the start and had never been measured:
/// the engine filled it with a literal `0.0`. It now carries the real peak, so
/// a v96 client shown a v97 reading would not merely mis-parse the tail — it
/// would read a field that used to be a constant. The handshake's equality test
/// is what stops it trying.
///
/// Two figures rather than one because neither answers alone. The peak cannot
/// tell a signal that fills the converter from one twice too large for it, and
/// the fraction saturates as soon as a constant-envelope signal passes √2 of
/// full scale — every sample of an FM carrier clips from there on. Together
/// they say whether the front end is into its rails and roughly how far.
///
/// `Meters` rides in an event only, never in a command, so this is a one-way
/// change: nothing a client sends carries it.
/// **98** — an IC-9700 on macOS, three ways (issue #192).
///
/// `Mode::SstvFm` — SSTV on an FM carrier, the way slow-scan is sent on VHF
/// and UHF — is appended to [`sdroxide_types::Mode`]. Appended, so every mode
/// already on the wire keeps its number; but the variant itself is new, and a
/// v97 peer handed one decodes it as nothing at all.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`] gained `rig_squelch`, the radio's *own*
/// squelch threshold as a `0..1` fraction of its scale, and
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gained `SetRigSquelch` to move it. A rig that
/// hands sdroxide audio it has already gated has the only squelch that can
/// open — `Command::SetSquelch` is a threshold on what got through — so the
/// SQL control follows [`sdroxide_types::DeviceCaps::commands_squelch`], also
/// new here, to whichever of the two the front end actually has.
///
/// Three appended fields and one appended variant: postcard numbers both by
/// position, so a v97 peer desynchronises on the tail of every `RadioState`
/// and every `DeviceCaps` regardless. The handshake's equality test is what
/// stops it trying.
///
/// **99** — ADS-B (issue #160).
///
/// `Mode::Adsb` is appended to [`sdroxide_types::Mode`], which is on its own
/// enough to force this bump: every mode already on the wire keeps its number,
/// but a v98 peer handed the new one has no variant to decode it into and
/// desynchronises on the rest of the message. That is the same reasoning as
/// v98's `Mode::SstvFm` and v89's `Mode::Aprs`.
///
/// With it: `ServerMsg::AdsbStatus` carrying the aircraft table,
/// `Command::SetAdsbConfig` to change how the decoder behaves, and
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioState::adsb`] holding what it was set to — all
/// appended, all at the end of their respective enums and structs.
///
/// The table is re-sent whole a couple of times a second rather than
/// incrementally, like the ISM device table and for the same reasons; the
/// per-aircraft position history is `f32` (about two metres at any latitude)
/// because it is the bulk of that message and a history dot on a map has no use
/// for more.
///
/// **100** — one appended field, `AdsbStatus::degraded` (issue #160).
///
/// A receiver can be able to run the ADS-B decoder and still be too narrow to
/// carry the waveform properly — below about 2.4 Msps a Mode S chip and a
/// sample are the same width, and the aircraft at the edge of range are lost to
/// arithmetic rather than to propagation. That is not the same statement as
/// `unavailable`, which means nothing is running at all, so it is a field of
/// its own rather than a reuse.
///
/// Appended at the end of the struct; postcard numbers fields by position, so a
/// v99 peer desynchronises on the tail of every `AdsbStatus` and the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// **101** — the QO-100 beacon calibration decoder.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`] gained `qo100`
/// ([`sdroxide_types::Qo100Settings`]) holding whether the decoder runs and how
/// wide it searches, and [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gained `SetQo100Config` to
/// move it — the ISM decoder's shape, no apply step, the engine echoes the
/// setting back in the state. Both are appended at the tail of their type, so
/// every field and variant already on the wire keeps its number; a v100 peer
/// desynchronises on the tail of every `RadioState` regardless, and the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// The live side — [`sdroxide_types::Qo100Status`] (lock, measured offset,
/// decoded telemetry text) — is a native-engine `RadioEvent` only and never
/// reaches the wire: `sdroxide-server` maps it to no `ServerMsg`, the same as
/// the spectrum lanes that travel their own way. So there is no new `ServerMsg`
/// here, and a remote client's window shows that the reading is local-only
/// rather than sitting on "starting…". If it is bridged later that is its own
/// append and its own bump.
/// **102** — RTTY on an FM carrier (issue #214).
///
/// `Mode::RttyFm` is appended to [`sdroxide_types::Mode`]: the same Baudot
/// modem, the same tone pair and the same panel as `Mode::Rtty`, into an FM
/// transmitter rather than onto a sideband. Appending a mode is on its own
/// enough to force this bump — every mode already on the wire keeps its number,
/// but a v101 peer handed the new one has no variant to decode it into and
/// desynchronises on the rest of the message. Same reasoning as v99's
/// `Mode::Adsb`, v98's `Mode::SstvFm` and v89's `Mode::Aprs`.
///
/// Nothing else changed: every table the new mode needs an answer in is
/// derived from the mode, not carried beside it.
/// **103** — recording the raw I/Q (issue #217).
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gained `SetIqRecording`, and
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`] gained `iq_recording`, `iq_recording_file`
/// and `iq_recording_mb` beside the audio recorder's three, so a remote client
/// can start a capture and watch it grow. Both appended at the tail of their
/// type, so every variant and field already on the wire keeps its number; a
/// v102 peer desynchronises on the tail of every `RadioState` regardless, and
/// the handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// The file is written by the *engine*, on the machine the receiver is plugged
/// into — a remote client's capture lands on the station, not on the laptop
/// that asked for it, because the alternative is a gigabyte a minute over the
/// link. That is a property of the feature and not of the wire, so nothing here
/// carries the samples.
/// **104** — NAVTEX (issue #212).
///
/// `Mode::Navtex` is appended to [`sdroxide_types::Mode`] and
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiStatus`] gains `navtex`
/// ([`sdroxide_types::NavtexStatus`]) beside the other per-mode panes, carrying
/// the messages received, the one arriving and the loose text.
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] gains `navtex_reverse`, the tone-sense
/// control — the mode's only setting, since there is nothing to transmit and no
/// callsign to give.
///
/// Appending a mode is on its own enough to force the bump, for the reason

/// **105** — EU VHF contest operation (issue #223).
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] gains `contest` (a new `ContestMode` enum)

/// `SetContestSerial` — the number's own write route, because the engine
/// advances it as each contact is logged and a client's copy of the

///
/// The `i3 = 5` message layout the mode transmits is not on this wire at all:

///
/// [`sdroxide_types::DeviceProbe`] gains `PublicSdrs { refresh }` and

///
/// The probe lane rather than a route of its own, and for one reason: a browser

///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Backend`] gains `KiwiSdr` and [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`]
/// gains `kiwi` ([`sdroxide_types::KiwiConfig`]) at its tail. Both are appended,

/// **107** — zooming the panadapter out past the I/Q.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::DeviceCaps`] gains `wide_span_hz` at its tail: how wide the

///
/// On the capabilities rather than on the frame because it is what bounds the

///
/// Appended, so every field already on the wire keeps its number; `DeviceCaps`
/// is sent whole, so a v106 peer desynchronises on the tail of it regardless,
/// which is what the handshake's equality test prevents.
/// **108** — the antenna a memory channel was stored on.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::MemoryChannel`] gains `antenna` at its tail: which socket
/// the radio was on when the channel was stored, so recalling a 2 m repeater

/// `None` there means "leave the antenna alone", which is deliberately not how

///
/// Appended, so every field already on the wire keeps its number; the memory
/// list is sent whole, so a v107 peer desynchronises on the tail of any channel

/// **109** — switching the radio itself off and on again.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gains `SetRigPower(bool)` and

/// (issue #239).
///
/// The command variant is appended, so every variant already on the wire keeps
/// its number, and the caps field likewise; `DeviceCaps` is sent whole, so a

/// **110** — importing a channel list.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gains `ImportMemories(Vec<MemoryChannel>)`: a

/// **111** — the antenna a memory is stored on becomes a field the operator can
/// set, rather than only whatever the radio happened to be on when the channel
/// was stored (issue #246).
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`]'s `EditMemory` gains `antenna`, beside the
/// `repeater` setup it already carried, and reads an absent one the same way
/// [`sdroxide_types::MemoryChannel::antenna`] does: recall this channel without
/// moving the antenna. A field added to an existing variant rather than a new
/// variant, so a v110 peer would decode the tail of one as garbage — which the

/// **112** — a memory scan can be pointed at chosen folders (issue #236).
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::ScannerConfig`] gains `folders`, the folders a
/// [`sdroxide_types::ScanKind::Memories`] scan runs over — empty for all of
/// them, which is what every existing setting means. The config rides both ways
/// (`Command::SetScannerConfig`, `RadioEvent::Scanner`), so a v111 peer would

/// one ever seeing it.
/// **113** — a memory scan can read its channels off the spectrum (issue #228).
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::ScannerConfig`] gains `mem_fast`, which puts every channel
/// inside one receiver window on the transform the panadapter is already made
/// from and visits only the ones something is on. Appended to the same struct
/// as 112's `folders`, and with the same consequence: it rides both ways, so
/// the handshake's equality test is what keeps a v112 peer from reading the
/// tail of it as garbage.
/// **114** — VDL Mode 2 (the datalink half of what an aeroplane broadcasts).
///
/// `Mode::Vdl2` is appended to [`sdroxide_types::Mode`], which on its own is
/// enough to force this bump for the reason v99's `Mode::Adsb` and v104's

///
/// With it: `ServerMsg::Vdl2Status` carrying the message log, the station table
/// and what each of the seven channels is doing, `Command::SetVdl2Config` to
/// change how the decoder behaves, and [`sdroxide_types::RadioState::vdl2`]
/// holding what it was set to — all appended, all at the end of their respective
/// enums and structs.
///
/// The log and the table are re-sent whole a couple of times a second rather
/// than incrementally, like the ADS-B aircraft table and for the same reasons; a

/// rather than whatever happens to arrive next.
/// **115** — stated tuning ranges follow the interface they were stated for
/// (issue #254).
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`] gains `freq_ranges_parked`, the RX/TX ranges
/// belonging to interfaces this radio is not on at the moment — what
/// `RadioConfig::set_backend` puts the old interface's numbers into when a tab
/// is moved to another device, so that a public receiver's published coverage

/// `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig` whole: a v114 peer
/// would read the tail of one as garbage, which is what the handshake's

/// **116** — binaural (pseudo-stereo) CW audio (issue #263).
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::RxState`] gains `binaural`, and with it
/// `Command::SetBinaural`. The field is appended to the end of the struct and

/// exchanged.
///
/// Nothing else on the wire moves: the widener runs on the *speaker* path of

/// **117** — the station's external transmit/receive switch (issue #227).
///
/// A relay board, a handshake line or a sound-card GPIO pin that grounds the
/// SDR's antenna while the station transmits, and sequences an amplifier with
/// it. [`sdroxide_types::StationConfig`] gains `relay`, `Command` gains

///
/// The command and the message are appended to the end of their enums as
/// always, but the config field is the reason this is a bump rather than a
/// free addition: `StationConfig` rides `RadioEvent::StationConfig` and
/// `ServerMsg::StationConfig` **whole**, so a v116 peer would read the tail of
/// every station bundle one field out — and that bundle carries the band plan
/// the client draws its band edges from. The handshake's equality test stops
/// that before a frame is exchanged.
/// **118** — the RigExpert Fobos SDR backend (issue #273).
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Backend`] gains `Fobos`, [`sdroxide_types::DeviceProbe`]
/// and [`sdroxide_types::ProbeAnswer`] each gain a `Fobos` variant that
/// enumerates one, and [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`] gains a `fobos` block.
///
/// The three enum variants are appended to the end of their own enums as
/// always, so no surviving discriminant moves and none of them is the reason
/// for this bump. The config field is: `RadioConfig` rides
/// `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig` **whole**, so a v117
/// peer handed one with a `FobosConfig` on the end has nowhere to put it and
/// reads the tail of every one of those messages out of step — the same
/// not-survivable addition every backend before this one made (v64 ELAD, v65
/// LimeSDR). `#[serde(default)]` rescues a `radio.json` written before this
/// existed, because JSON is self-describing; postcard is not, so it rescues
/// nothing on the wire. The handshake's equality test is what stops that
/// before a frame is exchanged.
///
/// v119: independent sideband — [`sdroxide_types::Mode::Isb`], appended to the
/// end of `Mode` so no existing discriminant moves. Nothing in the message set
/// changed shape, and that is exactly why the bump is needed: postcard decodes
/// a discriminant it has never heard of as an error, so a v118 client handed a
/// `RadioState` whose mode is 36 fails the whole frame rather than one field.
/// The handshake refuses the pairing instead (issue #280).
///
/// v120: the transverter table — [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`] gains
/// `transverters`, a list with a band and an offset per box. `RadioConfig`
/// rides `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig` **whole**, so a
/// v119 peer handed one with a list on the end reads the tail of every one of
/// those messages out of step — the same not-survivable addition every config
/// field before it made (issue #278).
///
/// v121: where the antenna is — [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`] gains
/// `rx_site`, which says whether this radio listens on the station's own
/// antenna or on somebody else's, and where that one is. Reception reports are
/// posted from it rather than from the operator's locator (issue #284). Same
/// not-survivable shape change as every config field before it: `RadioConfig`
/// rides `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig` whole, so a
/// v120 peer handed one with an enum on the end reads the tail of every one of
/// those messages out of step.
///
/// v122: the VDL2 decoder's two new counters (issue #265).
/// [`sdroxide_types::Vdl2Status`] gains `hdlc_bad` and `fec_bypassed`, which
/// say whether the data field unwrapped and whether the frame came through on
/// its check sequence alone. The struct rides `ServerMsg::Vdl2Status` whole and
/// is re-sent a couple of times a second, so a v121 peer would read the tail of
/// every one of them out of step.
///
/// v123: who sent the picture — [`sdroxide_types::SstvStatus`] gains `rx_id`,
/// the callsign a station sent as an FSK ID after its transmission (issue
/// #287). The struct rides `ServerMsg::SstvStatus` whole and is re-sent several
/// times a second while the mode is up, so a v122 peer handed one with an
/// option on the end reads the tail of every one of them out of step.
///
/// v124: the operator's own frequencies —
/// [`sdroxide_types::StationConfig`] gains `digi_presets`, the list a station
/// has added to the digital modes' own tables, and
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gains `SetDigiPresets` to edit it (issue #268).
/// The config rides `ServerMsg::StationConfig` whole, so a v123 peer handed one
/// with a list on the end reads the tail of it out of step; the command is
/// appended last, so no surviving discriminant moved.
///
/// v125: controlled-envelope SSB — [`sdroxide_types::TxState`] gains
/// `cessb_db`, and [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gains `SetCessb` to move it
/// (issue #283). `TxState` sits in the middle of `RadioState`, which travels
/// whole on every change, so a v124 peer desynchronises on everything after it;
/// the command is appended last, so no surviving discriminant moved.
///
/// v126: PureSignal on an HPSDR board —
/// [`sdroxide_types::HpsdrConfig`] gains `puresignal`, `ps_bins`, `ps_rate`
/// and `ps_frozen` at its tail (issue #283). `HpsdrConfig` is part of
/// `RadioConfig`, which rides `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and
/// `Command::SetRadioConfig` whole, so a v125 peer handed one with four fields
/// on the end of that block reads the tail of every one of those messages out
/// of step.
///
/// v127: the QO-100 spectral tracker — [`sdroxide_types::Qo100Settings`] gains
/// `park_lo_hz`, `park_hi_hz`, `decode_telemetry` and `auto_apply`, the
/// parking window the tracker searches and the two things it may do with what
/// it finds (issue #291). The struct sits inside `RadioState` with `vdl2`
/// after it, and `RadioState` rides `ServerMsg::State` whole on every change,
/// so a v126 peer handed one with four fields in the middle of that block
/// reads `vdl2` — and the tail of every state update — out of step. It also
/// rides `Command::SetQo100Config`, which a remote client sends whole when the
/// operator touches any of the page's chips.
///
/// [`sdroxide_types::Qo100Status`] grows in the same commit, but it is not on
/// the wire yet: `sdroxide_server` maps `RadioEvent::Qo100Status` to `None`
/// and the QO-100 readout is local to the receiving station.
/// v128: AIS — the ship-reporting system on the two 162 MHz channels.
///
/// `Mode::Ais` is appended to [`sdroxide_types::Mode`], which on its own is
/// survivable in one direction and not the other: postcard writes an enum's
/// discriminant positionally, so a v127 peer handed a mode it has no variant
/// for fails to decode the message carrying it — and `Mode` is inside
/// `RxState`, inside `RadioState`, which travels whole on every change.
///
/// With it: `ServerMsg::AisStatus` carrying the vessel table and what each
/// channel is doing, `Command::SetAisConfig` to change how the decoder
/// behaves, and [`sdroxide_types::RadioState::ais`] holding what it was set to
/// — the settings field appended at the tail of `RadioState`, so a v127 peer
/// would read the end of every state update out of step. Both the message and
/// the command are appended last in their enums, so no surviving discriminant
/// moved.
///
/// v129: per-band transmit drive calibration —
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`] gains `tx_drive_trim` at its tail, the
/// table that makes one Drive setting mean one output power on every band
/// (issue #295). `RadioConfig` rides `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and
/// `Command::SetRadioConfig` whole, so a v128 peer handed one with a field on
/// the end reads the tail of every one of those messages out of step.
///
/// v130: operator-defined open-collector control words —
/// [`sdroxide_types::HpsdrConfig`] gains `oc_table` at its tail and
/// [`sdroxide_types::HpsdrFilterBoard`] gains a `Custom` variant (issue #296).
/// The block sits in the middle of `RadioConfig`, which rides
/// `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig` whole, so a v129 peer
/// reads every field after `hpsdr` out of step; and the enum's new variant is
/// appended, so no surviving discriminant moved but a v129 peer handed one
/// fails to decode the message carrying it.
///
/// v131: the SDRplay gain controls say what they are and what they may reach.
/// [`sdroxide_types::GainElement`] gains a `unit`, because decibels are wrong
/// for one of them: an RSP's RF gain is a step into a band-dependent table and
/// a control that appended dB to it reported a number three times too small.
/// The struct rides `DeviceCaps` inside `ServerMsg::Capabilities`, which an RSP
/// now re-sends on every retune — the ladder's length belongs to the band — so
/// a v130 peer would read the tail of each one out of step rather than merely
/// missing a field.
///
/// With it, [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayConfig`] gains `hdr_bw` (which filter the
/// RSPdx's HDR path runs, previously left at the API's default because nothing
/// ever wrote it) and `extended_if_gr` (whether the IF gain reduction may go
/// below the API's 20 dB floor). Both sit at that block's tail, and
/// `RadioConfig` rides `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig`
/// whole, so a v130 peer handed one reads the tail of each of those out of step.
///
/// v132: [`ServerMsg::CapabilitiesUpdated`], which says the front end revised
/// what it said about itself rather than that there is a different one. The
/// distinction was free while the only thing that moved mid-session was an
/// antenna list a rig answered for once; the RSP's band-dependent LNA ladder
/// republishes on every crossing of a band edge, and a client that reads each
/// of those as a new radio throws away its wideband waterfall mid-QSY. The
/// variant is appended, so no surviving discriminant moved — but a v131 peer
/// handed one fails to decode the message carrying it.
/// v133: [`sdroxide_types::KiwiConfig`] gains `wf_zoom`, how far the
/// receiver's own waterfall is zoomed into its band (issue #303). `RadioConfig`
/// rides `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig` whole and
/// postcard describes nothing about itself, so a v132 peer handed one reads the
/// tail of every field after it out of step — the serde default that covers a
/// stored `radio.json` does nothing on the wire.
/// v134: `Command::TuneWidebandTo`, which points the front end so a wideband
/// decoder's *window* lands on a frequency rather than its dial (issue #310).
/// The ISM band buttons send it instead of `Command::SetVfo`. Appended, so no
/// surviving discriminant moved — but a v133 peer handed one fails to decode.
/// v135: the VDL2 channel plan is the whole 25 kHz raster rather than every
/// other slot of it, so [`sdroxide_types::Vdl2Settings::channels`] is fourteen
/// bits and not seven (issue #265). A `u8` on the wire where a `u16` is
/// expected does not simply carry the wrong channels — postcard varints them,
/// so a v134 peer reads the following fields out of step.
/// v136: [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`] gains `rx_audio_gain_db`, a fixed trim
/// on the receive audio for a rig whose own codec is quiet — the AF rail's top
/// is unity and could only turn such a radio down (issue #315). It sits among
/// that struct's sound-card fields, near its head, and `RadioConfig` rides
/// `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig` whole, so a v135 peer
/// handed one reads almost every field after it out of step.
/// v137: the receiving antenna. [`sdroxide_types::DeviceCaps`] gains
/// `has_rx_antenna` and [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`] gains `rx_antenna` — an
/// Icom's `0x12` reply carries that connector's in/out flag behind the socket,
/// and sdroxide had been writing the byte as zero on every antenna command,
/// switching an operator's receive aerial out of circuit on every band change
/// (issue #229). Both fields sit at their struct's tail, and both structs ride
/// whole inside `ServerMsg::Capabilities`, `ServerMsg::CapabilitiesUpdated` and
/// `ServerMsg::State`, so a v136 peer handed one reads the tail of every one of
/// those out of step rather than merely missing a field. With them,
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gains `SetRxAntenna`, appended, so no surviving
/// discriminant moved — but a v136 peer handed one fails to decode the message
/// carrying it.
/// v138: a session's worth of new wire, all of it appended and none of it
/// separable — a v137 peer handed any one of these reads the tail of the
/// message carrying it out of step.
///
/// * [`sdroxide_types::Band`] gains `Cm3`, the 3 cm band an IC-905 reaches
///   through the 10 GHz unit inside it (issue #326). A band rides inside
///   `RadioState`, the band stack, every memory and `DigiConfig::tx_audio_hz`,
///   and a discriminant a v137 peer has no name for stops it decoding any of
///   them.
/// * [`sdroxide_types::Meters`] gains `pa_temp_c`, a radio's own temperature
///   where it measures one — a Hermes-Lite 2 does (issue #333). It sits among
///   that struct's fields and `Meters` rides `ServerMsg::Meters` whole.
/// * [`sdroxide_types::QsoRecord`] gains `wrl_sent` and
///   [`sdroxide_types::NetworkConfig`] gains `wrl_api_key` and
///   `auto_upload_wrl`; `UploadTarget` and `LoginTarget` each gain `Wrl`, the
///   World Radio League logbook (issue #337). Both structs ride whole inside
///   `Command::SetNetworkConfig` and `RadioEvent::Ft8QsoLogged`, and the two
///   new variants are appended so no surviving discriminant moved — but a v137
///   client handed one has nowhere to put it.
/// * [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gains `LogQso`, which carries a hand-entered
///   contact to the WSJT-X UDP listeners the way the sequencer's own contacts
///   already went (issue #341). Appended, so no surviving discriminant moved.
/// v139: [`sdroxide_types::Meters`] gains `adc_overload`, the front end's own
/// converter-overflow flag where the radio reports one — a Hermes-Lite 2 does,
/// and on a direct-sampling board it is the only thing that can say the
/// converter is being driven into its rails by something outside the window
/// (issue #362). It sits among that struct's fields and `Meters` rides
/// `ServerMsg::Meters` whole, so a v138 peer handed one reads the tail of it
/// out of step. [`sdroxide_types::HpsdrConfig`] gains the loop that acts on it
/// — `auto_gain` and its five settings — appended to a struct that rides inside
/// `RadioConfig`, with the same consequence.
///
/// v140: the operator's own CW message buttons —
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] gains `cw_macros`, a list of the new
/// [`sdroxide_types::CwMacro`], each a label and the text that button sends
/// (issue #374). It sits with the other `cw_*` fields rather than at the tail,
/// so a v139 peer reads every field after it out of step; `DigiConfig` rides
/// inside `Command::SetDigiConfig` and `DigiStatus`, both of which cross the
/// link whole.
///
/// v141: the CW panel picks its decoder —
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] gains `cw_engine`, the existing
/// [`sdroxide_types::CwEngine`] the skimmer already chose between, because
/// DeepCW's output layer has no class for an accented letter and only the
/// timing decoder can copy one (issue #382). It sits with the other `cw_*`
/// fields rather than at the tail, so a v140 peer reads every field after it
/// out of step; `DigiConfig` rides inside `Command::SetDigiConfig` and
/// `DigiStatus`, both of which cross the link whole.
///
/// v142: [`sdroxide_types::Js8Msg`] gains `speed`, the submode a decoded
/// message actually arrived on. With multi-speed decoding on, four waveforms
/// share the sub-band and the conversation list was the one place that did not
/// say which of them carried a message (issue #389). It sits at that struct's
/// tail, and `Js8Msg` rides inside `Js8Status` and so inside `DigiStatus`,
/// which crosses the link whole — so a v141 peer handed one reads the tail of
/// every status update out of step rather than merely missing a field.
///
/// v143: [`sdroxide_types::Meters`] gains `passband_dbfs`, the level the
/// software squelch actually compares its threshold against — which is not
/// `s_dbm` beside it, and on a rig reporting its own meter is not the same
/// measurement at all, so there was nothing on screen to set the SQL rail
/// against (issue #394). It sits at that struct's tail and `Meters` rides
/// `ServerMsg::Meters` whole, so a v142 peer handed one reads the end of it out
/// of step.
///
/// v144: [`sdroxide_types::Band`] gains `M11`, the 11 m citizens' band — on the
/// bar so it can be tuned and listened to, and flagged as not an amateur
/// allocation so the transmit lockout still holds there (issue #396). A band
/// rides inside `RadioState`, the band stack, every memory and
/// `DigiConfig::tx_audio_hz`, and a discriminant a v143 peer has no name for
/// stops it decoding any of them.
///
/// v145: [`sdroxide_types::CatFamily`] gains `RsHfiq`, the HobbyPCB RS-HFIQ —
/// an I/Q transceiver whose whole control interface is a frequency command and
/// a transmit command (issue #383). The variant is appended, so no surviving
/// discriminant moved, but `CatFamily` rides inside `RadioConfig` and so inside
/// `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig`: a v144 peer handed
/// one fails to decode the message carrying it.
///
/// v146: `Command::SstvRestartRx` — abandon the SSTV picture being received and
/// hunt for the next header, so a VIS misread as a four-minute mode no longer
/// costs every picture sent while it runs out (issue #397). Appended, so no
/// surviving discriminant moved, but a v145 station has no name for it and
/// fails to decode the message carrying it.
///
/// v147: [`sdroxide_types::Backend`] gains `UsbAudio`, a radio with no control
/// port — receive and transmit over two sound cards, keyed by the rig's own
/// VOX (PR #456). Appended, so no surviving discriminant moved, but `Backend`
/// rides inside `RadioConfig` and so inside `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and
/// `Command::SetRadioConfig`: a v146 peer handed one fails to decode the
/// message carrying it.
///
/// v148: HD Radio reception — the FM digital sidecar (issue #437). `Mode::HdRadio`,

/// v149: [`sdroxide_types::Meters`] gains `puresignal`, what the adaptive

/// last, but `Meters` is a struct in a non-self-describing encoding: a v148
/// peer reads the extra bytes as the start of the next field and fails to
/// decode every meter update.
///
/// v150: the SSTV vocabulary grows — [`sdroxide_types::SstvMode`] gains the PD
/// family and the two Wraase SC-2 modes, and [`sdroxide_types::SstvStatus`]
/// gains `unsupported`, the name of a mode a header arrived for and this build
/// cannot draw (issue #421). The variants are appended so no surviving
/// discriminant moved, but a v149 peer has no name for the new ones and reads
/// the status's extra field as the start of the next, so every SSTV update
/// fails to decode.
///
/// v151: [`sdroxide_types::PublicSdrNetwork`] gains `SdrList`, the
/// `sdr-list.xyz` directory of PhantomSDR-Plus and friends (issue #482).
/// Appended, so no surviving discriminant moved, but it rides inside
/// `ProbeAnswer::PublicSdrs`: a v150 client handed a receiver from that
/// directory fails to decode the whole answer, and its browse window stays
/// empty rather than showing the two lists it does know.
///
/// v152: the CW keyboard straight key (issue #322). `Command::CwStraight` and
/// `Command::CwKey`, appended last so no surviving discriminant moved, but a
/// v151 peer has no name for either and fails to decode the message carrying it.
///
/// v153: station profiles (issue #197). `Command` gains `ProfileSave`,
/// `ProfileApply` and `ProfileDelete`, appended last so no surviving
/// discriminant moved, but a v152 station has no name for them and fails to
/// decode the message carrying one. `ServerMsg` gains `Profiles`, the names
/// to offer, appended last for the same reason: a v152 client handed the list
/// fails to decode it.
///
/// v154: ACARS, the VHF airband airline datalink (issue #436). `Mode::Acars` is
/// appended last, so no surviving discriminant moved, but a v153 peer has no
/// name for it. The status rides the existing `RadioEvent::Ft8Status` /
/// `ServerMsg::Ft8Status`, so there is no new message — but `DigiStatus` gains
/// a trailing `acars` field, and postcard numbers struct fields by position, so
/// a v153 peer desynchronises on the tail of every `DigiStatus`. The field is
/// last, so no surviving field moved.
///
/// v155: per-mode settings. The engine applies AGC, squelch, noise reduction
/// and the rest from a profile when the mode changes, and remembers what the
/// operator changes while a mode is selected, so `Command` gains
/// `ResetModeDefaults` — appended, so no surviving discriminant moved. The
/// profiles themselves travel as receiver state, so a v154 peer's state decode
/// is unchanged; it just cannot ask for a reset. Numbered after ACARS because
/// that landed upstream first (the two were in flight together).
///
/// v156: HD Radio's decoder is `libnrsc5`, loaded at run time rather than built
/// in (issue #488), so whether the mode works is the station's to say.
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`] gains `hd_radio_unavailable`, the reason to
/// show on the greyed-out mode. Appended last, but postcard numbers struct
/// fields by position: a v155 peer reads the extra bytes as the start of
/// whatever follows the state, and fails to decode `HelloAck` and every state
/// update.
///
/// v157: SSTV picture styling, `DigiConfig::sstv_style` (an
/// `sdroxide_types::SstvStyle`) — the banner strip's gradient and outline, the
/// banner text's colour, gradient and outline, a rainbow override for all the
/// picture's text, and the slot message's ink and outline. One appended field
/// rather than a dozen, and it lets a station give its picture a look rather
/// than one flat colour. Appended to `DigiConfig`'s tail, and `DigiConfig` rides
/// `Command::SetDigiConfig` and `DigiStatus` whole, so a v156 peer reads the
/// extra bytes as the start of the next field and fails to decode every digital
/// status.
///
/// v158: the (tr)uSDX family. [`sdroxide_types::CatConfig`] gains
/// `trusdx_audio`, which picks between audio in the CAT stream and a USB sound
/// card. `CatConfig` rides `Command::SetRadioConfig` whole, so the field sits
/// mid-struct on the wire even appended last in the struct, and a peer without
/// it runs off the end.
///
/// v159: NR2, the fifth noise-reduction engine — WDSP's Ephraim-Malah denoiser
/// ported to `sdroxide-dsp`. [`sdroxide_types::NrLevel`] gains `Nr2Low`,
/// `Nr2Med` and `Nr2High`, appended last so no surviving discriminant moved.
/// `NrLevel` rides `RadioState::noise_reduction` and `Command::SetNoiseReduction`,
/// so a v158 peer has no name for the three and fails to decode the state or the
/// command carrying one — but only once NR2 is actually selected, since nothing
/// else emits them.
///
/// v160: the CW panel is told whether the radio keys itself.
/// [`sdroxide_types::CwStatus`] gains `rig_keys_itself`, appended last, so the
/// panel can grey the straight key out with a reason instead of lighting it on
/// a rig that will never hand-key (issue #495). `CwStatus` rides
/// `DigiStatus::cw`, which is sent whenever a CW engine is running, so a v159
/// peer reads the extra byte as the start of the next field and fails to decode
/// every digital status.
///
/// v161: the HFDL ground-network decoder's settings, [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`]
/// gains `hfdl` (issue #497). Appended to `RadioState`'s tail, and `RadioState`
/// crosses whole, so a v160 peer reads the extra bytes as the start of the next
/// field and fails to decode every state — the same break `RadioState`'s other
/// appended decoders caused, and the same fix (the two sides must run in
/// lockstep). The live decode log is engine-side only
/// (`RadioEvent::HfdlStatus`), bridged nowhere.
///
/// v162: two CW conveniences from the same report (issue #495).
/// `DigiConfig::cw_sidetone` plays the keyed tone through the local speakers so
/// a `Sound card (MCW)` operator hears what they are sending, and
/// `DigiConfig::cw_tx_idle_s` makes the transmit-hold after the last character
/// or key release configurable. Both appended to `DigiConfig`'s tail, and
/// `DigiConfig` rides `Command::SetDigiConfig` and `DigiStatus` whole, so a
/// v161 peer reads the extra bytes as the start of the next field and fails to
/// decode every digital status.
///
/// v163: the CW straight key's self-decode, `CwStatus::sent_text` — what the
/// operator's own keying decoded to, so the straight key shows its characters
/// the way the text keyer shows typed ones (issue #495 follow-up). Appended to
/// `CwStatus`'s tail, after `rig_keys_itself`; `CwStatus` rides inside
/// `DigiStatus`, which crosses whole, so a v162 peer reads the extra bytes as
/// the start of the next field and fails to decode every digital status.
///
/// v164: PI4, the "Next Generation Beacon" propagation-beacon mode.
/// `Mode::Pi4` is appended, as is `ServerMsg::Pi4Spots`, so no surviving
/// discriminant moves; `DigiStatus` gained `pi4: Option<Pi4Status>` on its
/// tail, the same shape `wspr` already has, and `DigiStatus` rides whole, so
/// a v163 peer reads the extra bytes as the start of the next field and
/// fails to decode every digital status.
///
/// v165: band-decoder relay outputs (issue #442) — the HPSDR OC table's idea
/// (a per-band RX/TX output word), generalised to the generic T/R-switch
/// relay bank so a USB relay board, GPIO header, HID relay or external
/// command can switch an outboard filter or transverter by band too, not
/// only HPSDR's own seven-pin bus. `RelayRole` gains `BandDecoder`, appended,
/// so no surviving discriminant moves; `RelayConfig` gains
/// `band_table: Vec<RelayBandRow>` on its tail, and `RelayConfig` rides
/// whole inside `Command::SetRelayConfig`, so a v164 peer reads the extra
/// bytes as the start of the next field and fails to decode the command.
///
/// v166: MSK144, the meteor-scatter mode. `Mode::Msk144` is appended to that
/// enum, so no surviving discriminant moves. No new wire type: a decode is an
/// ordinary `Decode` with the burst's time into the slot as its `dt`, and the
/// mode is receive-only. `Mode` rides `RadioState`, so a v165 peer handed one
/// runs off the end of the enum — the same break every appended `Mode` causes.
///
/// v167: JT65 and JT9, the weak-signal slotted modes from mfsk-core.
/// `Mode::Jt65` and `Mode::Jt9` are appended to that enum, so no surviving
/// discriminant moves. No new wire type: a JT decode is an ordinary
/// `Decode` and rides the existing `RadioEvent::Ft8Decodes` path, and the modes
/// are receive-only so nothing else is added. `Mode` is postcard-encoded by
/// declaration index and rides `RadioState`, so a v166 peer handed one runs
/// off the end of the enum — the same break every appended `Mode` causes, and
/// the same fix (the two sides run in lockstep).
///
/// v168: FST4, the slow weak-signal mode. `Mode::Fst4` is appended to that
/// enum and `DigiConfig` gains `fst4_period` (`Fst4Period`) on its tail, since
/// the period is a setting rather than part of the mode. `DigiConfig` rides
/// `Command::SetDigiConfig` and `DigiStatus` whole, so a v167 peer reads the
/// extra bytes as the start of the next field and fails to decode every
/// digital status — the same break as v162's appended CW settings.
///
/// v169: Q65, the modern weak-signal mode. `Mode::Q65` is appended to that
/// enum and `DigiConfig` gains `q65_mode` (`Q65Mode`) on its tail, since the
/// sub-mode fixes the period and the tone spacing rather than being part of the
/// mode. `DigiConfig` rides `Command::SetDigiConfig` and `DigiStatus` whole, so
/// a v168 peer reads the extra bytes as the start of the next field and fails
/// to decode every digital status — the same break as v162's appended CW
/// settings.
///
/// v170: FSK441, the original meteor-scatter mode. `Mode::Fsk441` is appended
/// to that enum and `DigiConfig` gains `fsk441_period` (`Fsk441Period`) on its
/// tail, since the period is a setting rather than part of the mode. The
/// decoder is the fork's own — mfsk-core has no FSK441 — so it lives in
/// `sdroxide-dsp`; on the wire a decode is an ordinary `Decode` with the ping's
/// time into the slot as its `dt`. `DigiConfig` rides
/// `Command::SetDigiConfig` and `DigiStatus` whole, so a v169 peer reads the
/// extra bytes as the start of the next field and fails to decode every
/// digital status — the same break as v162's appended CW settings.
///
/// v171: FSK441's transmit half. `DigiStatus` gains `tx_refused`
/// (`Option<String>`) on its tail, the reason a key-up was refused — an empty
/// message box, most often — so a panel can say why rather than looking armed
/// and doing nothing. `DigiStatus` rides whole, so a v170 peer reads the extra
/// bytes as the start of the next field and fails to decode every digital
/// status. No new wire type: FSK441's transmit runs through the ordinary digi
/// engine seam (`DigiTxText`/`DigiTxActive`).
///
/// v172: editable message buttons for the keyboard modes (PSK / RTTY / Olivia
/// / Thor — issue #463). `DigiConfig` gains `text_macros` (`Vec<CwMacro>`) on
/// its tail: the same label-and-text buttons the CW panel has, on a list of
/// their own. `DigiConfig` rides `Command::SetDigiConfig` and `DigiStatus`
/// whole, so a v171 peer reads the extra bytes as the start of the next field
/// and fails to decode every digital status — the same break as v170's appended
/// FSK441 period.
///
/// v173: selectable FT8 decode depth. `DigiConfig` gains `ft8_depth`
/// (`Ft8Depth`) on its tail — `Fast` / `Normal` / `Deep`, how hard the decoder
/// works for weak signals (no subtraction / flat multi-pass SIC / the
/// checkpointed pass). `DigiConfig` rides `Command::SetDigiConfig` and
/// `DigiStatus` whole, so a v172 peer reads the extra byte as the start of the
/// next field and fails to decode every config — the same break as v172's
/// appended message buttons.
///
/// v174: the PlutoSDR's second receive chain can serve the RX1 radio as a
/// second aerial or as PureSignal feedback, and a GPO pin can switch an
/// amplifier in and out (issue #525). `PlutoConfig` gains `aux`
/// (`PlutoAuxConfig`, the same block a LimeSDR's second chain uses),
/// `pa_gpo` (`PlutoPaPin`), `pa_on` and `pa_active_low` on its tail, and the
/// radio configuration rides whole in both a command and an event, so a v173
